## Gabbar Is Back Movie Review: What Critics Say
 
Gabbar Is Back has received mixed reviews from critics, who have praised Akshay Kumar's performance and action sequences, but have criticized the screenplay, direction, and dialogues. The movie has also been compared unfavorably to the original Tamil movie Ramanaa and its other remakes.
 
Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the movie 1.5 stars out of 5 and wrote: "The trouble with this remake of a Tamil actioner is the trouble most such products are beset with: same strange lost-in-transmission flavor which doesnât transfer, mustachioed bad guys who look as if theyâve showed up from a different set, a leading lady who pops up for comic relief, and dialogues delivered at a decibel that threaten to damage your ear drums."[^1^]
 
Namashi Chakraborty of IMDb gave the movie 7 out of 10 and wrote: "A remake of the 2002 Tamil film Ramanaa, 'Gabbar is Back' is A Full-On Masala Entertainer! Its not an amazing film, but an engaging watch, nonetheless. Here's a film that's sure to work big time with the masses!"[^2^]

## Gabbar Is Back Movie Review: Final Verdict
 
Gabbar Is Back is a movie that caters to the fans of Akshay Kumar and masala movies. It has some moments of thrill and entertainment, but it also suffers from a weak script, poor direction, and loud dialogues.
