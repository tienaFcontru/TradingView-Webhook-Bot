The film played at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival and had an international release. It received some positive reviews in spite of its controversial subject.

The film's title refers to the French term for stepfather, which literally means "beautiful father". The film explores the themes of love, loss, sexuality, family and morality. It raises questions about the nature and boundaries of incest, consent, age difference and social norms.
 
The film has been released on DVD in several countries, including France, Germany, Spain and the United States. However, it is not widely available online due to its sensitive content. Some websites offer streaming or downloading options for the film, but they may not be legal or safe. One example is SoundCloud, where some users have uploaded the audio track of the film with the title "Beau Pere 1981 FRENCH DVDRip XViD AC3 HuSh catane daily economi" [^1^] [^3^]. This title seems to be a combination of the film's original title, its format, its audio codec, its release group and some unrelated words.
 
If you are interested in watching Beau Pere, you may want to look for a legitimate source that respects the rights of the filmmakers and the actors. You may also want to be aware of the potential legal and ethical issues that may arise from viewing such a film.

Beau Pere is not the only film that deals with the topic of incestuous relationships between a stepfather and a stepdaughter. Other examples include Lolita (1962 and 1997), American Beauty (1999), The Quiet (2005) and Fish Tank (2009). These films have different approaches and perspectives on the subject, ranging from satire to drama to thriller. They also have different levels of explicitness and controversy.
 
Some critics and scholars have argued that these films reflect the social and cultural changes that have occurred in the family structure and the sexual norms in the modern society. They have also suggested that these films challenge the conventional notions of morality, family and love. However, some viewers and activists have condemned these films as glorifying or normalizing pedophilia, abuse and exploitation. They have also expressed concern about the potential harm that these films may cause to the young actors and actresses who play the roles of the stepdaughters.
 
Whether you find these films fascinating or repulsive, you may want to be careful about how you watch them and how you discuss them with others. You may also want to consider the ethical and legal implications of your actions. Remember that these films are fictional representations of a complex and sensitive reality, and that they may not reflect the experiences or opinions of the people involved in such relationships.
