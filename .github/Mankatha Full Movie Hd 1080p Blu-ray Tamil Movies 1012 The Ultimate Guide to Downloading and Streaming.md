The plot of Mankatha revolves around a heist of 500 crores that is planned by Vinayak and his gang of four: Sumanth (Vaibhav), Mahat (Mahat Raghavendra), Prem (Premji) and Ganesh (Ashwin Kakumanu). They are aided by a local don Prithvi (Arjun), who is also a police officer and Vinayak's friend. However, things get complicated when Vinayak double-crosses his partners and runs away with the money. Prithvi and his team chase Vinayak across Mumbai and Goa, while Vinayak tries to escape with the help of his old flame Suchitra (Lakshmi Rai) and her friend Sabitha (Andrea Jeremiah).
 
Mankatha is a stylish and slick film that showcases Ajith's charisma and screen presence. He delivers a powerful performance as the anti-hero who is ruthless, cunning and unpredictable. He carries the film on his shoulders with his dialogue delivery, mannerisms and action sequences. Arjun is also impressive as the honest cop who is determined to catch Vinayak. He matches Ajith in every scene and adds to the thrill factor. The supporting cast does a decent job, with Premji providing some comic relief.
