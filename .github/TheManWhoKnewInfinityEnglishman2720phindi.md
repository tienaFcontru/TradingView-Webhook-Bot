# The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Biopic of an Indian Genius
 
The Man Who Knew Infinity is a 2015 British biographical drama film about the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, based on the 1991 book of the same name by Robert Kanigel. The film stars Dev Patel as Ramanujan, who was a self-taught prodigy who made extraordinary contributions to number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Jeremy Irons plays G.H. Hardy, the English mathematician who recognized Ramanujan's talent and invited him to Cambridge University during World War I. The film explores the cultural and personal clashes between the two men, as well as the racism and prejudice that Ramanujan faced in Britain.

Ramanujan was a child prodigy who showed a natural aptitude for mathematics at a very young age. He learned to read and write Tamil and English by himself and mastered advanced mathematics by reading books from the local library. He was fascinated by numbers and formulas and often experimented with them on his own. He also developed his own notation and methods of solving problems.
 
He completed his primary and secondary education in Kumbakonam, where he impressed his teachers and peers with his mathematical abilities. He won several scholarships and prizes for his academic excellence. However, he also faced many difficulties and hardships due to his family's poverty, his poor health, and his lack of formal guidance. He failed to obtain a college degree because he neglected all other subjects except mathematics. He also suffered from social isolation and depression due to his unconventional and obsessive pursuit of mathematics.
 
Despite these challenges, Ramanujan continued to work on mathematics on his own, using whatever resources he could find. He wrote down his results in notebooks without providing any proofs or explanations. He also tried to communicate his findings to other mathematicians, both in India and abroad. He sent letters to several eminent mathematicians, but most of them ignored or rejected him. However, one of them, G.H. Hardy, a professor at Cambridge University, recognized Ramanujan's genius and invited him to England in 1914.
 
Ramanujan spent five years in England, working with Hardy and other mathematicians at Cambridge. He published many papers in prestigious journals and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of Trinity College. He made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics, such as number theory, analysis, algebra, geometry, and combinatorics. He discovered hundreds of new theorems, formulas, identities, equations, and series, some of which are named after him. He also collaborated with Hardy on the famous Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula for the partition function.
 
However, Ramanujan's stay in England was also marred by several problems. He faced cultural and religious difficulties in adapting to the British society. He also missed his family and friends in India. Moreover, he contracted tuberculosis and suffered from various illnesses throughout his stay. His health deteriorated rapidly and he decided to return to India in 1919. He died a year later at the age of 32.
