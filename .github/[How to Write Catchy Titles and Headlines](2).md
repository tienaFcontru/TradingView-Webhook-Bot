She will encounter various deadly monsters and make several new friends along the way.

The game is a platformer with a charming pixel art style and a cheerful soundtrack. Fia can eat fruits to gain different abilities, such as double jump, dash, and charm. Charm allows her to turn enemies into allies, who will then help her with items, high jumps, hugs, and more. The game has multiple endings depending on Fia's actions and choices.
 
However, the game also has a dark side. Fia can lose her clothes and get injured by enemies, which will affect her appearance and movement. If she dies, she will face one of the 36 different game over scenes with CG art and voice acting. These scenes are graphic and violent, depicting Fia being raped, punched, stabbed, digested, chewed, and killed in various ways. The game also includes four extra gory death scenes from Hanakanmuri If as a bonus.
 
Hanakanmuri Circle is a game that appeals to both fans of cute and gruesome genres. It is a challenging and rewarding platformer with a lot of secrets and surprises. The game can be downloaded from GGBases[^4^] or played on YouTube[^5^] [^6^] [^7^].

The game has four stages, each with a different theme and a boss at the end. The stages are:
 
- Stage 1: Jungle. Fia explores the lush and colorful jungle, where she meets a friendly monkey and a helpful bird. She also faces dangers such as snakes, spiders, and carnivorous plants. The boss is a giant snake that tries to swallow Fia whole.
- Stage 2: Cave. Fia enters the dark and damp cave, where she encounters bats, slimes, and skeletons. She also finds a lantern that helps her see in the dark. The boss is a skeleton king that commands an army of undead.
- Stage 3: Ruins. Fia discovers the ancient ruins of a lost civilization, where she learns about their history and culture. She also meets a mysterious girl who seems to know her. The boss is a stone golem that guards the entrance to the temple.
- Stage 4: Temple. Fia reaches the final stage, where she finds her parents trapped by a cult that worships a dark god. She also faces the most powerful and twisted enemies in the game, such as cultists, demons, and zombies. The boss is the dark god himself, who tries to corrupt Fia with his evil power.

The game has multiple endings depending on Fia's actions and choices throughout the game. Some of the factors that affect the endings are:

- Fia's charm level. This is determined by how many fruits she eats and how many enemies she charms. A higher charm level makes Fia more friendly and innocent, while a lower charm level makes her more aggressive and selfish.
- Fia's clothes condition. This is determined by how much damage she takes from enemies and traps. A higher clothes condition makes Fia more modest and shy, while a lower clothes condition makes her more bold and confident.
- Fia's friendship level. This is determined by how many friends she makes along the way and how much she interacts with them. A higher friendship level makes Fia more loyal and caring, while a lower friendship level makes her more lonely and indifferent.
- Fia's moral choices. This is determined by how Fia responds to certain situations and dilemmas in the game. Some of these choices are obvious, while others are hidden or subtle. A higher moral level makes Fia more righteous and heroic, while a lower moral level makes her more wicked and villainous.

The game has four main endings and several variations depending on these factors. The main endings are:
