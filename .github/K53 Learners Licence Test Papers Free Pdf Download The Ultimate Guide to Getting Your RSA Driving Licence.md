- **Relax and be confident.** On the day of the test, don't panic or stress yourself out. Relax and trust your preparation. Be confident in your abilities and don't let negative thoughts distract you. Read each question carefully and choose the best answer. If you are unsure about a question, skip it and come back to it later. Don't waste time on questions that you don't know.
