If you are a fan of racing games, you might have heard of Need For Speed Underground 2, a popular game released in 2004 by EA Games. This game is the eighth installment in the Need For Speed series and the direct sequel to Need For Speed Underground. It features a variety of cars, tracks, modes, and customization options that will keep you entertained for hours.
 
However, if you want to play this game on your PC, you might encounter some difficulties. The original game requires a CD-ROM to install and run, which can be inconvenient or impossible for some users. Moreover, some versions of the game might ask you to complete a human verification process before downloading or installing, which can be annoying or time-consuming.

Fortunately, there is a way to download and install Need For Speed Underground 2 (v1.2) without human verification or CD-ROM. All you need is a reliable internet connection, some free disk space, and a few simple steps. Here is how you can do it:
 
1. Download the ISO files of the game from a trusted source. You can find them on various websites, such as [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/nfsu2cd1) [^2^] or [4shared.com](https://www.4shared.com/rar/K4qxaKw8ku/Need_for_Speed_Underground_2_V.html?locale=en) [^3^]. Make sure you download both CD1 and CD2 files.
2. Extract the ISO files using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get two folders named "NFSU2 CD1" and "NFSU2 CD2".
3. Mount the ISO files using a software like PowerISO or Daemon Tools. This will create virtual CD-ROM drives on your PC that will act as if you have inserted the actual CDs.
4. Open the "NFSU2 CD1" folder and double-click on the file named "NFSUnderground2\_1.2\_setup.exe". This will launch the game setup wizard. Follow the instructions on the screen and enter the CD key when prompted. You can find the CD key in a text file inside the same folder.
5. When the setup asks you to insert the second CD, switch to the "NFSU2 CD2" folder and double-click on the file named "SPEED2.exe". This will mount the second ISO file and continue the installation.
6. When the installation is complete, unmount both ISO files and delete them from your PC. You don't need them anymore.
7. Download and install the patches 1.1 and 1.2 from [PCGamingWiki.com](https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1065-need-for-speed-undergound-2-patches/) [^4^]. These patches will fix some bugs and improve the game performance.
8. Download and replace the original "SPEED2.exe" file with a no-CD crack from [GameCopyWorld.com](https://gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_nfs_underground_2.shtml) . This will allow you to run the game without inserting any CD.
9. If you want to play the game in widescreen mode or with other enhancements, download and install the Widescreen Fix from [GitHub.com](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/releases/tag/nfsu2) . Follow the instructions on how to use it.
10. Enjoy your game!

That's it! You have successfully downloaded and installed Need For Speed Underground 2 (v1.2) without human verification or CD-ROM. Now you can enjoy one of the best racing games ever made on your PC.
