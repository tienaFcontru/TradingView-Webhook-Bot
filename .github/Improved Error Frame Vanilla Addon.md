In this article, we will explain what this addon does, how to install it, and how to use it.
 
## What is Improved Error Frame Vanilla Addon?
 
Improved Error Frame Vanilla Addon is an addon that enhances the default error frame in World of Warcraft. It displays multiple errors in a scrollable and selectable frame, allowing you to copy the error text and view it at your leisure. It also adds a button on the minimap that shows the number of errors pending view and blinks when new errors occur. You can also customize the addon's settings, such as enabling or disabling sound notifications, always showing or hiding the button, and displaying the stack trace along with the error message.
 
## How to Install Improved Error Frame Vanilla Addon?
 
To install Improved Error Frame Vanilla Addon, you need to download the addon file from a reliable source, such as [Legacy WoW](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/improved-error-frame/), [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4333-ImprovedErrorFrame.html), or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-96). After downloading the file, you need to unzip it and place it in your World of Warcraft addons folder. The default location of this folder is C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\\_classic\_\Interface\AddOns. You may need to create the AddOns folder if it does not exist.

## How to Use Improved Error Frame Vanilla Addon?
 
To use Improved Error Frame Vanilla Addon, you simply need to play the game as usual and wait for any errors to occur.

You can click on this button to open the error frame and see the details of each error. You can also drag this button around the minimap to adjust its position.
 
The error frame shows you the error message, the time it occurred, and the stack trace (if enabled). You can scroll through the errors using your mouse wheel or the arrows on the frame. You can also select and copy the error text using your mouse or keyboard shortcuts. To close the error frame, you can click on the close button on the top right corner or press escape.
