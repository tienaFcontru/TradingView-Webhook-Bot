## Step 1: Open Your Image in Photoshop
 
Launch Photoshop and open the image that you want to remove the background from. You can use any image format that Photoshop supports, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc. For this tutorial, we will use this image of a woman holding a flower:

Make sure that your image is in RGB mode by going to Image > Mode > RGB Color. If your image is in CMYK mode, you will need to convert it to RGB before using OnOne Mask Pro 4.1.
 
## Step 2: Launch OnOne Mask Pro 4.1
 
To launch OnOne Mask Pro 4.1, go to Filter > onOne Software > Mask Pro 4. This will open the OnOne Mask Pro 4.1 interface, which looks like this:

On the left side of the interface, you will see the Toolbox, which contains various tools for selecting and masking your image. On the right side of the interface, you will see the Preview Window, which shows you how your image looks with the current mask applied. You can also switch between different views by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the Preview Window.
 
## Step 3: Select Your Background Color
 
The first step in creating a mask is to select the background color that you want to remove from your image. To do this, click on the Eyedropper tool in the Toolbox and then click on an area of your image that represents the background color. For example, we clicked on the blue sky in our image:
